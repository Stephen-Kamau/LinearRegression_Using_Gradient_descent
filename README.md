# LinearRegression_Using_Gradient_descent
## This script shows how to create a linear regression model using gradient descent as loss function
## It is just a simple algorithm that uses for loop to get loss and update weights and biasess accordingly.
## It Assumes the equation `pred = m * X + b` to perfom estimations.
